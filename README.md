*This project is an updated version of [homebridge-unifi-guest-wlan-switch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge-unifi-guest-wlan-switch) with the dependancies fixed to allow it to work on the current versions of the Unifi Controller and HomeBridge. 

Due to the way Node-Unifi now handles multiple sites, support for this has been removed. You will need a homebridge for each site to deal with this now, say hi if your the one person this change is going to effect. This code is far from great but it does seem to basically work now, maybe one day I will tidy it up some more or some nice person will make a PR. In the meantime enjoy using at your own risk, I didn't write this.*
